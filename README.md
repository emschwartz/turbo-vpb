## Code Overview

- [`server`](./server) - the TurboVPB API and website
- [`extension`](./extension) - source code of the extension

## Technical Details

The TurboVPB extension parses contact details from the virtual phone bank page and sends them to a static site loaded on the caller's phone. Messages are encrypted between the extension and the static site such that the server cannot read the contact details.

To connect the extension and mobile page, the user scans a QR code generated by the extension with their phone.
The link encoded in the QR code points to https://turbovpb.com/connect and includes connection details in the query parameters and hash/fragment.

**TurboVPB never collects or stores the names, phone numbers, or any personal details of people contacted.**

### Encrypted WebSocket PubSub

TurboVPB uses is a publish-subscribe pattern where the messages are end-to-end encrypted using symmetric encryption.

For each phone bank session, the extension uses the browser's [`SubtleCrypto.generateKey()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/SubtleCrypto/generateKey) method to create an AES-GCM encryption key with a 256-bit key.
The encryption key is passed to the static mobile site in the URL fragment/hash at the end of the URL encoded in the QR code.
In addition, the extension generates a random PubSub channel ID, which is also communicated to the mobile page in the connection URL.

## Thanks

### Open Source

Major thanks to the following open source projects that made this possible:

- [Tingle](https://tingle.robinparisi.com/)'s plain vanilla modal plugin
- [kjua](https://larsjung.de/kjua/)'s QR code generator
- Mozilla's [Web Extension polyfill](https://github.com/mozilla/webextension-polyfill)

And thanks to all of the people who work on Web standards like WebSockets, WebRTC, and Web Crypto.

### Sponsored Services

TurboVPB would have been much more difficult (and expensive) to build and run without the sponsored open source plans from:

- [Sentry](https://sentry.io)
- [BrowserStack](https://browserstack.com)

And the generous free tiers of:

- [Cloudflare](https://cloudflare.com)
- [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com)
- [ImprovMX](https://improvmx.com)
